Javascript already has several well-established game engines, but
gaming in the browser is still in an early phase. As javascript gets
new features, browsers get faster, and new APIs are created, there is
a lot of research to be done in this area.

Please don't actually this for anything practical. A lot of the code
here will depend on newer Javascript features that might only be
available in one browser.

Each folder contains a game engine with an experimental architecture,
usually driven by one single new API or language feature.
