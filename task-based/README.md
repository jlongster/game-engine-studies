This game engine is based on [task.js](http://taskjs.org/), which is a
tiny coroutine library based on Javascript 1.8's new
[`yield`)(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/yield)
feature.

Is started out as a regular old engine, but it being converted into
the yield-based architecture.
